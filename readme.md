# This is a blank canvas for a Backbone.Marionette application

There's actually more here than just [Backbone.Marionette](http://marionettejs.com/). There's also:

* [Handlebars](http://handlebarsjs.com/), for templating
* [Foundation](http://foundation.zurb.com/), for HTML and CSS
* [Backbone.LocalStorage](https://github.com/jeromegn/Backbone.localStorage), for local storage
* [RequireJS](http://requirejs.org/), for module loading
* [Bower](http://bower.io/), for package management

To get started, you need to [have bower installed](http://bower.io/#installing-bower), and run ```bower install``` in the root directory.
