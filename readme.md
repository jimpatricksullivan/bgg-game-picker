# BoardGameGeek Game Picker

When complete, this will be a JavaScript application that uses the [boardgamegeek.com api](http://boardgamegeek.com/wiki/page/BGG_XML_API) to select a random owned game in a user's [collection](http://boardgamegeek.com/wiki/page/collection) which meets certain criteria, such as number of players, maximum run time, or minimum rating. Handy when you have lots of games and can't decide what to play.

This is built on top of [Marionette Boilerplate](https://github.com/jimpatricksullivan/marionette-boilerplate).
